#since the repo is public and already cloned the easiest way to get authed is to make a change and push it to the repo. Before that you have to give your username and password to the global config for git

git clone https://github.com/abortedalien/dragun0v

cd dragun0v

git config --global user.name "your_github_username"
git config --global user.email "your_github_email"

#once you run those commands make a change and run through the git add and git commit commands

git add . 
git commit -m "your_message_here"

#once you push youâ€™ll be promoted for your username and the personal access token

git push -u origin main
